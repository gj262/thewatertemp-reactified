[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gj262/thewatertemp-reactified.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gj262/thewatertemp-reactified)

[_The Water Temp_](https://thewatertemp.vmbed.com/) is an alternate view of water temperature data provided by the [NOAA CO-OPS](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Physical%20Oceanography).

What is the water temperature now? How has it been for the last 24 hours? What about nearby?

NOAA has a number of monitoring stations throughout the US that collect water temperature data. For a particular station this app will show the latest temperature read and the range of temperatures over 24 hours. For comparison it can also show the temperature ranges for the last seven days or for this day in prior years.

It is designed to work on small screens i.e. phones.

## Motivation

This is primarily an exercise in developing a modern web application with React+Typescript.
